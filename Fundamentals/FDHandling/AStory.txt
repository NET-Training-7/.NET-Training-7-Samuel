Once upon a time, there was a tiny ant named Andy.
 Andy lived in an anthill with his colony and spent his
  days gathering food for the queen. One day, while out 
  foraging, Andy stumbled upon a piece of candy. 
  Overwhelmed with excitement, he brought the candy back to 
  the colony to show the others. However, when the queen found 
  out about the candy, she became angry and demanded that Andy
   dispose of it immediately. Feeling dejected, Andy took the 
   candy and left the colony, determined to find a place 
  where he and his candy would be appreciated.
